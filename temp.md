❌ Bad Code:

```javascript
function sum() { return a + b; }
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ The function `sum` attempts to add variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope.
This will likely result in an error or unexpected behavior, as it relies on global variables (which is bad practice) or
undefined variables.
* ❌ The function does not accept any arguments, limiting its reusability and flexibility. A good sum function should be
able to add any two numbers provided to it.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:

* ✔️ Accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, making the function reusable and versatile.
* ✔️ The `return` statement is on a separate line for improved readability (though not strictly necessary for such a
simple function).
* ✔️ The function now correctly adds the two input numbers and returns the result.

Additional Notes:

* Consider adding error handling (e.g., checking if the inputs are numbers) for a more robust solution, especially if
this function is part of a larger application.
* While the original code is concise, clarity and correctness are paramount. The revised code prioritizes these aspects.
